### OpenGL Graphics Abstraction
A simple wrapper for OpenGL when I was learning graphics programming. Uses modern C++ features.
The namespace "cyber" is used as this project was originally a part of the remake I'm creating for Cyber Slayer.
There's still a couple pieces of unfinished code as this is a slightly older version.
- C++23
- Abstractions for different buffer types and shaders.
- GLM, GLFW, glad 2
