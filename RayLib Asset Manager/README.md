## RayLib Asset Loader / Manager -- C++20
Tough one for me. This was for a game jam called Wasteland Game Jam 2 written in a friend of a friend's custom C++ engine. Unfortunately I think we overscoped and we didn't end up submitting on time. Nevertheless, there was a lot to be proud of for this project, and the team created some great content. Just had some bugs and issues we couldn't stomp out before the end. I didn't go into it looking to have anything for my portfolio, but I already did something similar like this in projects before, so I decided that the asset manager is worthy of a showcase. It's a simple singletone that can load assets that raylib can process. The user can also retrieve an asset by calling `AssetManager::get<AssetType>("file_stem_for_asset");`. Lots of excuses to work with C++20 template magic. Another thing that I learned how to do was implement heterogeneous lookup for the maps in order to avoid creating copies of `std::string` every time a lookup would be called. It was a fun little exercise!
