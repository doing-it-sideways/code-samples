# Code Samples
Snippets of code from different projects I've worked on over time. Code is separated into folders for each project.

## Gameboy Emulator
The repository for this project is fully public, please check it out [here](https://github.com/doing-it-sideways/gameboy-emulator).
- C++
- OpenGL, GLFW, GLM, glad 2, Dear ImGUI

## Renderer Project
While working on a complete engine remake of Cyber Slayer, I realized I needed to learn graphics programming, so these files have some abstractions of common renderer objects like VBOs, VAOs, RenderBuffers, etc.
The main namespace used is called "cyber" but there is nothing directly related to Cyber Slayer in these samples.
Credit to TheCherno for some of the inspiration behind the abstractions.
- C++
- OpenGL, GLFW, GLM, glad 2
